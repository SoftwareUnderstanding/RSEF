Contributing Guide\nTo ensure the quality of the MIOpen code base, the MIOpen team has \nestablished a code review process to inform developers of the steps \nthat are required to shepherd a change-set into the repository.\n\n#### Table Of Contents\n\n[How to get started](#How-to-get-started)\n\n[How do I contribute?](#how-do-i-contribute)\n  * [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)\n  * [Creating a Pull Request](#Creating-a-Pull-Request)\n\n[Responsibility of the Author](#Responsibility-of-the-Author)\n\n[Responsibility of the Reviewer](#Responsibility-of-the-Reviewer)\n\n[Passing CI](#Passing-CI)\n\n[The Review](#the-review)\n## How to get started\nMIOpen is AMD\u2019s deep learning primitives library which\nprovides highly optimized, and hand-tuned implementations of\ndifferent operators such as convolution, batch normalization,\npooling, softmax, activation and layers for Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs), used in both training and inference.\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to check out [MIOpen documentation](https://rocmsoftwareplatform.github.io/MIOpen/doc/html/) and [MIOpen: An Open Source Library For Deep Learning Primitives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00078.pdf).\n\nAll contributions you make will be under the [MIT Software License](LICENSE.txt). \n## How do I contribute\n### Reporting Issues\nWe use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/issues) to track public **bugs** and **enhancement requests**.\n\nIf you have found an issue, please check [MIOpen documentation](https://rocmsoftwareplatform.github.io/MIOpen/doc/html/) to see if it is a bug or new feature enhancement which is not supported in the latest version of MIOpen:\n\n#### Bugs\nPlease follow the template below to report any bugs found in MIOpen:\n\n1. Description: ***Please be clear and descriptive***\n2. How to Reproduce the issue:\n* Hardware Information:\n* Docker environment or Software Version:\n* Expected behavior:\n* Actual behavior:\n3. Any additional information:\n\n#### Enhancement Requests\nPlease follow the template below to report any enhancement requests for MIOpen:\n\n1. Description: ***Please be clear and descriptive***\n2. Value and Motivation:\n* Feature and functionalities enabled:\n* Any alternatives:\n3. Any additional information:\n\nThe author must set labels (and assigns a miliestone) according to his/her own understanding.\n\nOther contributors can change these values if they disagree. That being said, \nadding a small comment explaining the motivation is highly recommended. \nIn this way, we keep the process flexible while cultivating mutual understanding.\n\n[**Note**] Most likely, the labels like \"bug\", \"feature\" or \"complexity*\" \nwould not be changed. However, \"value*\" or \"urgency*\" might be from mutual \nunderstanding.\n### Creating a Pull Request\nNo changes are allowed to be directly committed to the develop \nbranch of the MIOpen repository. All authors are required to \ndevelop their change sets on a separate branch and then create \na pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the develop branch.\n\nOnce a PR has been created, a developer must choose two reviewers \nto review the changes made. The first reviewer should be a \ntechnical expert in the portion of the library that the changes \nare being made in. You can find a list of these experts in \n[MIOpen Issue #789](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/issues/789)\n. The second reviewer should be a peer reviewer. This reviewer \ncan be any other MIOpen developer.\n\n## Responsibility of the Author\nThe author of a PR is responsible for:\n * Writing clear, well documented code\n * Meeting expectations of code quality\n * Verifying that the changes do not break current functionality\n * Writing tests to ensure code coverage\n * Report on the impact to performance\n\n## Responsibility of the Reviewer\nEach reviewer is responsible for verifying that the changes are \nclearly written in keeping with the coding styles of the library, \nare documented in a way that future developers will be able to \nunderstand the intent of the added functionality, and will \nmaintain or improve the overall quality of the codebase.\n\nReviewer's task checklist:\n1. Has the PR passed [necessary CI](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/pull/932#discussion_r634835432)?\n2. Does the PR consist of a well-organized sequence of small commits, \neach of which is designed to make one specific feature or fix \n(and ideally should be able to pass CI testing)?\n3. Does the PR only include a reviewable amount of changes? Or it is a \nconsolidation of already reviewed small batches? e.g. break it into smaller \ntestable and reviewable tasks instead of a huge chunk at once.\n4. Does the PR have sufficient documentation and easy to read and understand, \nfeasible for test and future maintainence, related docs already in place? \ne.g. revise or add to \n[MIOpen documentation](https://rocmsoftwareplatform.github.io/MIOpen/doc/html/) \nif API or functionality has changed?\n5. For bugfixes and new features, new regression test created and included in CI,\n or some other holistic test pipeline?\n6. Is every PR associated with a ticket or issue number for tracking purposes?\n\n## Passing CI\nThe most critical component of the PR process is the CI testing. \nAll PRs must pass the CI in order to be considered for merger. \nReviewers may choose to defer their review until the CI testing \nhas passed. \n\n## The Review\nDuring the review, reviewers will look over the changes and make \nsuggestions or requests for changes.\n\nIn order to assist the reviewer in prioritizing their efforts, \nauthors can take the following actions:\n\n* Set the urgency and value labels\n* Set the milestone where the changes need to be delivered\n* Describe the testing procedure and post the measured effect of \n  the change\n* Remind reviewers via email if a PR needs attention\n* If a PR needs to be reviewed as soon as possible, explain to \n  the reviewers why a review may need to take priority\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "documentation": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/tree/develop/docs", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "For a detailed description of the **MIOpen** library see the [Documentation](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/projects/MIOpen/en/latest/).\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Documentation", "parent_header": ["MIOpen"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Run the steps below to build documentation locally.\n\n```\ncd docs\n\npip3 install -r .sphinx/requirements.txt\n\npython3 -m sphinx -T -E -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en . _build/html\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "How to build documentation", "parent_header": ["MIOpen", "Documentation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/wiki", "format": "wiki"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/README.md"}], "has_script_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/utils/install_precompiled_kernels.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/src/composable_kernel/script/run.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/src/composable_kernel/script/hipclang_opt.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/src/composable_kernel/script/docker-rocm4.1.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/src/composable_kernel/script/count_vgpr.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/develop/src/composable_kernel/script/cmake-rocm.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "## Prerequisites\n\n* More information about ROCm stack via [ROCm Information Portal](https://docs.amd.com/).\n* A ROCm enabled platform, more info [here](https://rocm.github.io/install.html).\n* Base software stack, which includes:\n  * HIP -

If a different backend other than what currently exists on the system is desired, please uninstall the existing backend completely and then install the new backend.\n\n## Installing MIOpen kernels package\n\nMIOpen provides an optional pre-compiled kernels package to reduce the startup latency. These precompiled kernels comprise a select set of popular input configurations and will expand in future release to contain additional coverage.\n\nNote that all compiled kernels are locally cached in the folder `$HOME/.cache/miopen/`, so precompiled kernels reduce the startup latency only for the first execution of a neural network. Precompiled kernels do not reduce startup time on subsequent runs.\n\nTo install the kernels package for your GPU architecture, use the following command:\n\n```\napt-get install miopenkernels-<arch>-<num cu>\n```\n\nWhere `<arch>` is the GPU architecture ( for example, `gfx900`, `gfx906`, `gfx1030` ) and `<num cu>` is the number of CUs available in the GPU (for example 56 or 64 etc). \n\nNot installing these packages would not impact the functioning of MIOpen, since MIOpen will compile these kernels on the target machine once the kernel is run. However, the compilation step may significantly increase the startup time for different operations.\n\nThe script `utils/install_precompiled_kernels.sh` provided as part of MIOpen automates the above process, it queries the user machine for the GPU architecture and then installs the appropriate package. It may be invoked as: \n\n```\n./utils/install_precompiled_kernels.sh\n```\n\nThe above script depends on the __rocminfo__ package to query the GPU architecture.\n\nMore info can be found [here](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/blob/develop/doc/src/cache.md#installing-pre-compiled-kernels).\n\n## Installing the dependencies\n\nThe dependencies can be installed with the `install_deps.cmake`, script: `cmake -P install_deps.cmake`\n\nThis will install by default to `/usr/local` but it can be installed in another location with `--prefix` argument:\n```\ncmake -P install_deps.cmake --prefix <miopen-dependency-path>\n```\nAn example cmake step can be:\n```\ncmake -P install_deps.cmake --minimum --prefix /root/MIOpen/install_dir\n```\nThis prefix can used to specify the dependency path during the configuration phase using the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.\n\n* MIOpen's HIP backend uses [rocBLAS](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocBLAS) by default. Users can install rocBLAS minimum release by using `apt-get install rocblas`. To disable using rocBLAS set the configuration flag `-DMIOPEN_USE_ROCBLAS=Off`. rocBLAS is *not* available for the OpenCL backend.\n\n* MIOpen's OpenCL backend uses [MIOpenGEMM](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpenGEMM) by default.
